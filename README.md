# About the bot
Rushia is a bot written by [alecchangod](https://github.com/alecchangod) in [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)

# [Add rushia to your server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=953567399687364659&permissions=8&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
It will require admin permission(all permission) by default. If you don't like that, you can use [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=953567399687364659&permissions=2068063845568&scope=bot%20applications.commands) instead. Incase any feature doesn't work, just tell me. I'll updated the link.

## Suggestion/bugs
If you have any suggestion or found bug please tell me in the [discord support channel](https://discord.gg/j9yHKXdyhM).

### Current feature 

#### Use with prefix + {command name}
Example: =ping
By default, the prefix is "=". You can change that with the setprefix command.

Useage: {prefix}say {content}

REQUIRE ADMIN/MANAGE MESSAGES PERMISSION TO USE
Useage: {prefix}spam {amount} {content}
- time - get current time(yeah it is just such a useless command)
- tl - translate something to another language(hardcoded target language to zh-TW for now. Use slash command version for more opition)

Useage: {prefix}tl {content}
- warn - warn a user(can't warn admin)
REQUIRE ADMIN/TIMEOUT MEMBERS PERMISSION TO USE
Useage: {prefix} warn {tag the target user here} {reason for warning}

#### Use with slash command
Give the bot permission to create slash command and just type "/" in the chat box and command will appear.
You can choose opition for the command.
